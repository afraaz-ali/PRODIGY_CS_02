Simple Image Encryption Tool
This project is a basic image encryption and decryption tool that uses pixel manipulation techniques. 
It allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by modifying pixel values using a user-specified key.
This project was developed in PyCharm Communitiy Edition

Features
Image Encryption: Swaps and alters pixel values using a key to create an encrypted image.
Image Decryption: Reverses the encryption process to recover the original image.
User-Friendly Interface: Uses a file dialog for easy selection of image files.
Supports Multiple Formats: Compatible with common image formats like PNG, JPG, and JPEG.

How It Works
Encryption: The tool modifies the pixel values of the image based on a key, swapping adjacent pixels and altering their RGB values.
Decryption: The original image is restored by reversing the encryption process using the same key.

Usage
Select an image file to encrypt or decrypt using the provided file dialog.
Enter an integer key for the encryption or decryption process.
The processed image is saved in the same directory as the original.

Notes
The same key must be used for both encryption and decryption to retrieve the original image.
